# Low Latency Transaction Processor

Now ten years old, the proof-of-concept of a low-latency transaction processor based on the LMAX disruptor library (magic ring buffer).

This project was created between Apr 11 2012 and May 4 2012.

It was fun and exciting to work on this code.

Results from performance benchmark:
```
166389 req/sec, 1000000 in 6010 msec(s), missed 0
```
Nice!
